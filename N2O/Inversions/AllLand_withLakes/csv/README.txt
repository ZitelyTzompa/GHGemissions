This directory contains csv files created using the time series for all land including lakes and rivers. 
The time series from the ACTM model was not used to create a csv file because there were many outliers in its N2O fluxes for several countries (e.g. China 2010 vs. 2011).
All files were created by Zitely Tzompa Sosa.
